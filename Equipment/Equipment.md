Different stages of bread baking require different tools. Here's a list of essential equipment for home baking, along with more advanced alternatives if you want to improve your process:

- [[Container]] for prefermented dough - You'll need an airtight container to make prefermented dough. A Mason jar with a lid works well and should be at least 0.75 L. However, you can also use any container with a lid, plastic wrap, or a bowl covered with a cloth.
- Large Mixing [[bowl]] - A mixing bowl is necessary to mix, stretch, and fold dough. You'll want a bowl that's about 4 L in size, but any container big enough to accommodate your dough will work.
- [[Proofing basket]] - Also known as a banneton, a proofing basket is used to support the dough while it rises during the final proofing stage. If you don't have a proofing basket, you can substitute it with any basket or container that's lined with a tea towel or cloth napkin.
- Tea [[Towel]] or [[Cloth napkin]] - To cover the dough while it rises and to line the proofing basket.
- [[Baking vessel]] - You'll need a vessel to bake the bread in. A large glass or ceramic [[Baking dish]] with a cover works well. If you don't have a lid, you can substitute it with an [[Aluminum container]] or foil. A [[Dutch oven]] is a better, but more expensive solution.
- [[Parchment paper]] - Parchment paper is useful for lining the baking vessel and for transferring the dough to the vessel.
- [[Razor blade]] or [[Sharp knife]] - A razor blade is ideal for scoring the dough, but you can also use a sharp knife or scissors.
- [[Oven]] - An oven that can be heated up to 250Â°C is necessary for baking bread.

By having the right equipment, you'll be well on your way to successful home bread baking.
