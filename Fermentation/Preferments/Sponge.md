Sponge is a type of preferment that is used in some traditional bread recipes. It has a relatively short fermentation time, usually 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, and uses a ratio of 100% [[Flour]], 60% [[water]], and 1% [[yeast]]. Once the surface of the mixture is bubbly, the sponge is ready to be added to the final dough.

Sponge is commonly used in recipes for Italian [[bread]], [[ciabatta]], and [[Bagels]]. These breads have a distinct flavor and texture that is enhanced by the use of sponge.
