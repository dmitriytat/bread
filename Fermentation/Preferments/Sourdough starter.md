Sourdough starter is a type of natural preferment made with flour and water that captures wild [[yeast]] and [[Bacteria]] from the environment. It is usually allowed to ferment for several days before being added to the final dough. Sourdough starter can add a unique flavor and texture to [[bread]], as well as increase its nutritional value and digestibility.

Here are a few examples of [[bread]] that can be made using a sourdough starter:

1. Classic [[sourdough bread]]: The use of sourdough starter in classic sourdough bread can help develop a tangy, complex flavor and a chewy, rustic texture.
2. [[Whole wheat bread]]: Sourdough starter can help soften the bran in whole wheat flour, making it easier to digest and resulting in a tender crumb and nutty flavor.
3. [[Rye bread]]: A sourdough starter can be used in rye bread to help develop a more pronounced sourdough flavor and a dense, hearty texture.

Ingredients:

- Unbleached [[All-purpose flour]], [[Whole wheat flour]], or [[Rye flour]]
- Non-chlorinated [[water]]
- A [[jar]] 0.75L for first days
- A [[jar]] 0.3L for maintenance

Note: Chlorine can inhibit the growth of yeast and bacteria. Use filtered, bottled, or boiled [[water]] that has been cooled to room temperature.

Instructions:

1. In a large [[jar]], combine the 150g of [[Flour]] and 150g of [[water]].
2. Stir until well combined and the mixture is smooth.
3. Cover the [[jar]] and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours. It should be covered with a breathable material like a [[Cheesecloth]] or a kitchen [[towel]], or just loosely closed with a lid to allow air to flow in and out while keeping dust and debris out.
4. After 24 hours, discard 200g. Add 100g of [[Flour]] and 100g of [[water]] to the remaining mixture. Stir until well combined and smooth. It's important to make sure there are no lumps in the mixture, as these can create dry spots in the starter that can lead to mold growth. So, it's a good idea to whisk the mixture or use a fork to break up any clumps.
5. Repeat step 4 every 24 hours for 5-7 days, until the starter is bubbly, has a sour aroma, and shows signs of activity (such as bubbles and expansion) within a few hours of feeding. Observe the starter closely to make sure it's healthy and active. If the starter shows any signs of mold, bad odor, or discoloration, discard it and start again.
6. Once your starter is active, reduce the amount of ingredients: 30g of starter, 30g of [[water]] and 30g of [[Flour]]. You can also reduce the feeding frequency, store it in the refrigerator, and feed it once a week to maintain it. If you store it in the refrigerator, take it out and let it come to room temperature before feeding it.
7. To use your sourdough starter in a recipe, take out the amount needed and feed the remaining starter with equal parts of [[Flour]] and [[water]]. For example, if you take out 60g of starter, you should feed the remaining starter with 30g of [[Flour]] and 30g of [[water]]. If you need more than that, make levain the day before.

Important thing to keep in mind is that [[sourdough bread]] takes longer to rise than [[bread]] made with commercial [[yeast]]. This is because the wild [[yeast]] in the starter is slower to ferment than commercial [[yeast]]. Depending on the recipe and the temperature of your kitchen, the dough may take anywhere from a few hours to overnight to rise. Be patient and let the dough rise until it has doubled in size before baking it.

When baking with sourdough starter, it's important to use the right techniques to get the best results.
