Pâte fermentée is another type of preferment commonly used in bread baking. Unlike [[poolish]], pâte fermentée is made with a portion of already-made dough from a previous bread recipe, along with additional [[Flour]], [[water]], [[yeast]], and [[salt]]. This dough is allowed to ferment for a period of time before being added to the final bread dough. Pâte fermentée can help enhance the flavor, texture, and shelf life of bread.

Here are a few examples of bread that can be made using pâte fermentée:

1. [[Baguette]]: The use of pâte fermentée in [[baguette]] dough can help create a chewy, flavorful crust and a soft, airy interior.
2. [[Sourdough bread]]: Pâte fermentée can be used in sourdough bread to help develop a more complex flavor and improve the structure of the crumb.
3. [[Rustic country bread]]: Adding pâte fermentée to a rustic country bread recipe can result in a [[bread]] with a more open crumb, a chewy crust, and a nuttier flavor.

Here's a recipe for a basic pâte fermentée:

Ingredients:

- 200g [[Bread flour]]
- 120g [[water]]
- 3g [[salt]]
- 1/8 tsp instant [[yeast]]
- 200g of leftover [[bread]] dough (preferably from the same recipe you'll be using it for)

Instructions:

1. In a mixing [[bowl]], combine the [[Bread flour]], [[water]], [[salt]], and [[yeast]].
2. Add the leftover bread dough and mix until well combined.
3. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled [[bowl]], cover with [[plastic wrap]], and let it rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours.
5. Punch down the dough and shape it into a ball.
6. Store the pâte fermentée in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or use it immediately in your bread recipe.
