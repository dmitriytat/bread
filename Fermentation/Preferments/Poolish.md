Poolish is a type of preferment made with equal parts flour and water and a small amount of yeast. It is usually allowed to ferment for several hours before being added to the final dough. Poolish can add complexity and depth of flavor to bread, as well as increase its hydration and improve its texture.

Here are a few examples of bread that can be made using a poolish:

1. [[Baguette]]: The use of poolish in French [[baguette]] can help create a crisp, crusty exterior and a light, airy interior.
2. [[Ciabatta]]: Poolish can give ciabatta its signature open crumb and chewy texture.
3. [[Bread]]: A poolish can be used in bread to help develop a deeper, more complex flavor.

Here's a recipe for a basic poolish:
