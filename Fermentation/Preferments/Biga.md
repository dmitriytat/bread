Biga is another type of preferment used in bread baking. It is similar to [[poolish]], but is made with a higher proportion of [[Flour]] to [[water]], resulting in a stiffer dough. Like [[poolish]], it is allowed to ferment for several hours before being added to the final dough.

Here are a few examples of bread that can be made using a biga:

1. Italian [[bread]]: The use of biga in Italian bread can help create a chewy, rustic crust and a dense, flavorful crumb.
2. [[Baguette]]: Biga can be used in baguette dough to create a chewy texture and a slightly sweet, nutty flavor.
3. [[Whole wheat bread]]: Using a biga in whole wheat bread can help improve its flavor and texture, making it more moist and chewy.

Here's a recipe for a basic biga:

Ingredients:

- 300g [[Bread flour]]
- 150g [[water]]
- 1/4 tsp instant [[yeast]]

Instructions:

1. In a large [[bowl]] or [[jar]], combine the [[Flour]], [[water]], and [[yeast]].
2. Stir until well combined and the mixture forms a stiff dough.
3. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-10 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.
4. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 12-18 hours, until the biga is bubbly and has a slightly tangy aroma.
5. Use the biga immediately, or store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
